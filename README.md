# ground-server-spring
Ground Server for the Platform infrastructure, Spring-ified

## Requirements
You will need `gradle`. On Mac OSX, you can run `brew install gradle` if you do not already have it.

## Running
In order to run `gs-backend`, you need some one-time setup. Run `./setup` in order to create the dependencies.

Then run `./run` in order to start up the server on port `9000`!
